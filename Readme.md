Testing


Testing 

When testing i have been working with validator.w3.org for the HTML and for the CSS jogsaw.w3.org validator. 

When testing the first time i got a few errors regarding the icon links. And the links to each site. I first started doint the project in visual studios but later on changed to gitpod and then i hadent made a few changes to connect each website. 
And i also got a warning regardning one section that lacked a h element.
